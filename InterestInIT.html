  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

   <h2>Areas of interest in IT</h2>
   <p>Anna’s main interests in IT are Web Design, UX (User eXperience), UI (User Interface), and Game Design.</p>

   <p>Web Design, UX and UI are interrelated disciplines that focus on easing the connection between humans and computers. They perform that through the use of appealing, consistent and intuitive design as well as visual aesthetics that are pleasing to the eye and communicate meaning, identity and emotion to the user. They often utilise many principles of art and design, including (but not limited to) composition, use of negative space, colour theory, shape language and contrast. As this world becomes more and more digitised, websites and applications are being used by more and more people to manage various aspects of their daily lives, bringing in the need for more variety and innovation in design for applications and websites to serve a wider range of clients.</p>

  <p>At its core, game design covers a range of principles that use mechanics, rules and systems to make an engaging and challenging experience for the players. Video games, in particular, require knowledge in many different fields, such as programming, 3D/2D art and animation, and tend to require a large team and many years of development. The video game industry is ever-evolving and constantly changing, with new advancements in hardware and graphics processing technology allowing for even more life-like and realistic simulations. Even in the realm of stylized games, there are endless opportunities to innovate on each genre and its particular mechanics in fun and creative ways.</p>

  <h2>Experience with IT</h2>
  <p>While Anna did not have much interest in IT prior to starting university, she had played with <i>Scratch</i> (a building-block visual programming language designed for children) but more for its ability to create animated movies than its intended purpose. A few years ago she began to become interested in game design from watching videos about it on Youtube, which inspired her to take a course from <i>Murdoch University</i> in <i>Game Design</i>. While she did well in the subject, she realised that having prior programming knowledge would have been an invaluable skill. She discovered her passion for UI/UX design while working on a peer’s project. She currently has limited experience with <i>Python</i> and <i>C#</i>, and plans to learn more about the world of technology and its many different fields.</p>

  <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>

  <p>Anna learned about RMIT from her father, who has experience working on projects with RMIT professors. He recommended the teaching staff at RMIT as being very knowledgeable, so when Anna started <i>Open University</i> (OUA)  she considered RMIT as a good option. She decided to take a course at RMIT and found the presentation of the material clean and easy to follow. So far Anna has found many subjects that she’s interested in at RMIT, and she is looking forward to enrolling in them as she works towards a Bachelor of IT. </p>

  <h2>Learning Expectations at RMIT</h2>

  <p>As Anna currently does not have much technical knowledge or computer science expertise, she would like to broaden her understanding on the subject during her time at RMIT. She would also like to further develop her programming skills and become proficient in multiple programming languages, as well as learning to use other IT tools like <i>GitHub</i>. Managing deadlines and being able to complete projects from start to finish in a timely manner is also an important skill, and Anna would like to develop a good attitude towards work as she takes on more subjects.</p>
