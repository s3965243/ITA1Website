  <h2>What the test results mean for me</h2>

  <p>The results from all of these tests describe me quite well. I have taken the MBTI test multiple times and have gotten a consistent result of INFP-T, which would solidly indicate that I’m a sensitive, introspective and curious person with an active imagination. INFPs tend to be idealistic and can have unrealistic expectations for both themselves and the world, which could cause problems with setting feasible goals. The percentages for each trait are relatively consistent, being in the low 70s, with the exception of Feeling, being at 64%. This is notedly lower than scores from previous attempts, indicating that my logical thinking and feeling processes are starting to balance each other out. </p>

  <p>The Learning Styles test showed that I am predominantly a Kinesthetic learner, which was surprising to me as I had always assumed myself to be an Aural learner. The Big Five test results lined up quite well with the results from the MBTI test, with the only things to note being that my Agreeableness score was lower than expected and my Conscientiousness score was higher than expected, as INFPs are known to be very friendly and compassionate, but also easily distractible. </p>

  <p>The high openness score explains why I would choose to study IT, a field which I had no prior experience or interest in, as I like to try new things and have knowledge in a variety of areas. The relatively high neuroticism score shows that I am prone to overthinking or stressing out, and that I might like to avoid an intensive job. Things I would like to work on are managing my negative emotions, being able to focus for longer periods, having realistic expectations, and using more rationality when making decisions.</p>

  <h2>How these results may influence team behaviour</h2>

  <p>In a team, my abstract and intuition-based way of thinking might allow me to come up with innovative ideas and brainstorm easily, but I could potentially have trouble committing to one idea. Having high openness and agreeableness would make it easy for me to cooperate with others and be flexible with plans, but as an introvert it is also likely for me to withdraw from communication or team meetings. </p>

  <p>Being a kinesthetic learner means that I have to try things out to understand how they work, which may make my learning process a bit slower. While being empathetic could make me a good source of moral support, I’ve noticed that I tend to stress out over deadlines, and can sometimes take criticism badly. </p>

  <h2>Things to take into account when forming a team</h2>

  <p>I have a natural eye for design and aesthetics, and would work best in UI, adding finishing touches and making things visually appealing. I also have very good communication skills and can easily and effectively communicate my ideas. While I am decent at understanding and applying technical concepts, I wouldn’t consider it a strong point and might need some help from my team to bring myself up to their level of understanding. I wouldn’t be good in a leading position, as I tend to follow rather than initiate, but am willing to step up if required.</p>
