  <h2>Position Description</h2>

  <p>The advertisement above is one looking for a UI designer to work at Electronic Arts (commonly abbreviated as EA). EA is a video game company that publishes both console and mobile games, and are best known for series like FIFA, Mass Effect, and Battlefield. The UI designer is expected to work in a team to design and implement the UI in EA’s various mobile games from the initial concept to the finalised interface. The designer is also expected to seek user feedback and update the UI accordingly.</p>

  <h2>What makes this position appealing to me?</h2>
  <p>For me, this job is appealing for a multitude of reasons.</p>

  <p>It aligns with both of my interests perfectly. I’ve been interested in how video games are made for a while, and I’ve found that the areas of IT I’m most interested in involve design in some aspect. This job advert is looking for people that are passionate in precisely those subjects, a description that would fit me nicely. While it is not guaranteed that every element of this job will be enjoyable, being able to do a job that I have familiar knowledge in and am interested in would help to ease me into the work environment.</p>

  <p>EA is a well-known company that has developed a number of established franchises.There are a lot of potential opportunities that could arise from working at this company. I’d be able to learn from my colleagues and other professionals in the industry and develop a network of referrals for future jobs. </p>

  <p>This job complements my current talents and skills, and would allow me to use them more effectively. My specialty is in art and visual design, and I have knowledge of what constitutes intuitive and appealing design, which I can app What excites me the most about this job is the challenge of trying to design an interface that is easy to understand and facilitates the user to make the most out of its features, while also giving them an idea of the application’s identity. I have an eye for detail, and am good at looking at designs from a client’s point of view and spotting potential usability issues. So this job would give me the perfect opportunity to practice and develop my current skill set.</p>
