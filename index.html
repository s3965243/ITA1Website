        <p>Anna Liu is a first year university student with a keen interest in design and technology. Her parents were from Hong Kong but immigrated to Australia to pursue further education. Anna was born in Gippsland, rural Victoria, but moved to suburban Melbourne when she was in early primary school. Before starting this subject, she had previously completed two other university subjects, <i>Introduction to Game Design</i> and <i>Introduction to Programming</i>. She plans to continue completing more subjects and eventually enrol in the Bachelor of IT. She is most fluent in English, but aspires to learn other languages such as French, Chinese and Japanese.  </p>    
        <p>Annaâ€™s favourite hobby is cartoon-style digital illustration and other related art forms, which she has been doing since childhood. She has an interest in many different types of media, such as cartoons, anime, video games and webcomics, and often enjoys drawing fanart or reading fanfictions based on them. Some of her favourite pieces of media include <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>, <i>Miraculous Ladybug</i> and <i>Studio Ghibli</i> movies. </p>
